Supermarket, It is simply a retail shop whereas customers do self-services to acquire household goods. So in order to get things from supermarkets people are required to get them for themselves, what will happen when someone want to purchase something and he/she is far or when time isn’t friendly or when things are too many to carry them all around by himself/herself. We usually don’t consider these factors because most of us plan for an exact day to go shopping to the supermarkets else when we have a serious emergency that is only then we are forced to postpone our activities thus saving some few hours for shopping. What if, what we are looking for are not available in all supermarkets within the current region? ; This can cost us almost the whole day searching for non-existing item
